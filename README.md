# Intro
You may run across a few acronyms: natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG)â€”which are roughly speaking "read text", "understand meaning", "write text" respectively. Increasingly these tasks overlap and it becomes difficult to categorize any given feature. Hopefuly this API can help.
